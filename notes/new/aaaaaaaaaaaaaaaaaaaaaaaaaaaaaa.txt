What happens if an index does not fit into RAM?
If the indexes do not fit into RAM, MongoDB reads data from disk which is relatively very much slower than reading from RAM.

What is Aggregation in MongoDB?
Aggregations operations process data records and return computed results. Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents together, and can perform a variety of operations on the grouped data to return a single result. MongoDB provides three ways to perform aggregation: the aggregation pipeline, the map-reduce function, and single purpose aggregation methods and commands.
