express vhost

I found that express apps are functions. Calling them with (req, res, next) is all you need to do to pass a request from one app to another.

In the example below, I have one root app app and two branches app0 and app1.

var app0 = require('./app0');
var app1 = require('./app1');

var app = express();
...
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  if (some_condition_on(req)) {
    app0(req, res, next);
  } else {
    app1(req, res, next);
  }
});
