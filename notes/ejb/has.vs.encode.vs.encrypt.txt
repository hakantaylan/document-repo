In computer’s language, Hash a is a fixed length string generated for a data. This generated string is HASH. You can’t generate back the data from this string (hash).
There are many algorithms to generate hash like MD5, SHA-1.
For same data, hash will be same but same hash doesn’t mean data is same.
Like two identical products will belong to same aisle of the store but two products in same aisle doesn’t mean the products are same.
Hashing is used in blockchain, Bloom filters, Indexing.
