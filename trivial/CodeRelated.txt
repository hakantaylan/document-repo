Document databases reverted back to the hierarchical model in one aspect: storing nested records within their parent record rather than in a separate table
However, when it comes to representing many-to-one and many-to-many relationships, relational and document databases are not fundamentally different: in both cases, the related item is referenced by a unique identifier, which is called a foreign
key in the relational model and a document reference in the document model

Which data model leads to simpler application code?
If the data in your application has a document-like structure (i.e., a tree of one-to-many relationships, where typically the entire tree is loaded at once), then it’s probably a good idea to use a document model. The relational technique of shredding—splitting a document-like structure into multiple tables can lead to cumbersome schemas and unnecessarily complicated application code.

However, if your application does use many-to-many relationships, the document model becomes less appealing. It’s possible to reduce the need for joins by denormalizing, but then the application code needs to do additional work to keep the denormalized
data consistent. Joins can be emulated in application code by making multiple requests to the database, but that also moves complexity into the application and is usually slower than a join performed by specialized code inside the database.
In such cases, using a document model can lead to significantly more complex application code and worse performance

For highly interconnected data, the document model is awkward, the relational model is acceptable, and graph models are the most
natural.
If your application has mostly one-to-many relationships (tree-structured data) or no relationships between records, the document
model is appropriate.
But what if many-to-many relationships are very common in your data? The relational model can handle simple cases of many-to-many relationships, but as the connections within your data become more complex, it becomes more natural to start modeling your data as a graph.
