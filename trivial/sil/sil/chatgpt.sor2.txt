My entities have id generated like tihs:
    @Id
    @UuidGenerator(style = UuidGenerator.Style.VERSION_7)
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.UUID)
    private UUID id;
and i want to use id for equals/hashcode and it must not be null (If it is null before persisting and set after persist, this may cuase some problems)

How can i write a wrapper which uses hibernate VERSION_7 generator under the hood and use it like this:
    @Id
    private UUID id = UUIDWrapper.generateUUID();

Are you sure hibernate uses this. Bu this is incubating with hibernate 7.2.1. What if hibernate decides to use another library in the future? Is not there another way to use it through wrapper hibernate classes?

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.github.f4b6a3</groupId>
            <artifactId>uuid-creator</artifactId>
            <version>4.7.1</version> <!-- pick a current version -->
        </dependency>

import com.github.f4b6a3.uuid.UuidCreator; import java.util.UUID;
public final class UUIDWrapper { private UUIDWrapper() {}
// returns a time-ordered UUID (UUIDv7-like)
public static UUID generateUUID() {
    return UuidCreator.getTimeOrdered(); // time-ordered (v7-style) UUID
}
}
