Spring MVC metrics
Spring Boot Actuator automatically collects the following metrics related to Spring MVC:

1- Request Count:
Number of requests received by the application.

2- Error Count:
Number of requests that resulted in an error (such as 4xx or 5xx HTTP status codes).

3- Average Response Time:
Average time taken to process a request and send a response.

4- Max Response Time:
Maximum time taken to process a request and send a response.

5- Min Response Time:
Minimum time taken to process a request and send a response.

6- Response Time Distribution:
Distribution of response times across different percentiles (e.g., 50th, 75th, 90th percentile).

7- Request Rate:
Rate at which requests are being received by the application.

8- Host Metrics:
Metrics related to the host where the application is running, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space.

9- JVM Metrics:
Metrics related to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) where the application is running, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and garbage collection statistics.

These metrics can be exposed via HTTP endpoints provided by Spring Boot Actuator, and they can be monitored and analyzed using various

transactionIdPrefix
With EOSMode.V2 (aka BETA), the only supported mode, it is no longer necessary to use the same transactional.id, even for consumer-initiated transactions; in fact, it must be unique on each instance the same as for producer-initiated transactions. This property must have a different value on each application instance.
